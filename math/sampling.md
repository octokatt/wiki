description: How to Get a Representative Sample
---

In nearly any real-world case, information on the entire population will not be available.  Instead, statisticians try to get a representative sample of the total population, so descriptive statistics of the sample to generalize to the population.

Finding the right sample size is pretty simple, and a lot of online sites like (this)[https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm] will do the calculation for you.

Some definitions to keep in mind:

* _Margin of Error_ is how far off the descriptive statistics of the sample might be from the population's descriptive statistics.
* _Confidence Interval_ is how replicatable the results will be.  For example, a confidence interval of 95% means that 19 times of 20, the results are good.  This can be hacked, (relevant xkcd)[https://xkcd.com/882/].
* _Population Size_ is (WYSIWYG)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG].  That said, sometimes this will need to be estimated since the true population size may not be known.
* _Likely Sample Proportion_ is a little tricky.  This can be estimated with a pilot study, or left at 0.5 to have the most conservative estimate.
