# python

This section... is currently a pile of notes from across about five years, and hasn't really been cleaned up much.  Everything is correct, but there's a decent bit of mess.  You've been warned.


General things to keep in mind with Python:

* Python is _zero-indexed_; everything starts at 0
* `strptime` goes from string to datetime object, `strftime` goes the other way
