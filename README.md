# Welcome, Internet Strangers!

Hi, Internet strangers!

This is a giant gitbook I'm making to keep track of all of the different things I've learned about data-science-related-things. Feel free to make use of this in your own journey, but I'll readily admit the main reason for it's existence is to act as a personal reference.

I strongly suggest having a spellbook like this as a best practice, by the way, because being able to read about a core concept again after a few months \(in your own words\) is a huge help for your memory.
